Goal: Generate exploit bytecode based on poc

[Introduction]

Example                 ----> nday vulnerabilities, there is a full report 
generateROP             ----> uses pwntools open source project, the goal is to generate rop chain progress: when calling the function of pwntools project, error

generateShellCode       ----> connect  shellcode. Shellcode001.py is the case of mips 32 bit big ending

Pwn                     ----> directory of open source project https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools

pwnlib                  ----> open source project https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools

scanningModule          ----> Calculates the offset of the stack overflow vulnerability. Principle: Progress: This code is available for CVE-2017-13772. Only a few instructions have been identified so far.

attackBlock.txt         ----> The last generated bytecode. The tool user adds the bytecode to the trigger string after the poc to generate exp. Progress: Currently only for strcpy((char*)a1,(char*)a2). Found 4 vulnerabilities.

generateAttackBlock.py  ----> main program

[How to use]
# Router-Exploit-Shovel

Note: generate ROP chain based on pwntools project
run "sudo python generateAttackBlock.py -b binaryFile -o overflowFunctionPointOffset"

such as "sudo python generateAttackBlock.py -b squashfs-root/usr/bin/httpd -o 0x00478584"
